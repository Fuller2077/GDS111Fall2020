<!--Bio About Self-->
<p style="width: 800px;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hello my name is Nick, I was born on the 21st of June 1996 in a small town in upstate New York.
    After Highschool I wasn't sure what I wanted to do as a career so I decided to
    enlist in the Navy. I served for 5 years in the Navy as a Corpsman, which is the Navy and 
    Marine Corps version of a medic/combat medic. I had been stationed in both hospitals as well as with Marine
    Infantry and Tank units over my 5 years, to incluide a deployment to Norway up in the arctic circle. When my 
    contract with the Navy had started to come to it's end I knew I wanted to pursue a career in something I was passionate about, which lead me to game design at NEIT.
    I have been playing video games for as lomng as I can remember, starting with a gameboy color and slowly moving onto other handhelds until me and my brother got a PS2.
     The PS2 was my eye opener on what games can really offer and over the years they have been my main
    hobby and now I hope I can continue the passion I have for gaming as a career and make the games of the future.
