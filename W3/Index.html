            <p>Hello my name is Nick, I was born on the 21st of June 1996 in a small town in upstate New York.
                After Highschool I wasn't sure what I wanted to do as a career so I decided to
                enlist in the Navy. I served for 5 years in the Navy as a Corpsman, which is the Navy and 
                Marine Corps version of a medic/combat medic. I had been stationed in both hospitals as well as with Marine
                Infantry and Tank units over my 5 years, to incluide a deployment to Norway up in the arctic circle. When my 
                contract with the Navy had started to come to it's end I knew I wanted to pursue a career in something I was passionate about, which lead me to game design at NEIT.
                I have been playing video games for as lomng as I can remember, starting with a gameboy color and slowly moving onto other handhelds until me and my brother got a PS2.
               Then I started gaming on a PC as my main sysytem since highschool and that had opened my eyes as to how intricate and customizable games could be with games that allowed you to make levels within them to using third-party mods to tweak the game to be what I want. Now I hope I can continue the passion I have for gaming as a career and make the games of the future.</p>
